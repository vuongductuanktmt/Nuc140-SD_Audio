This Basic Software Package (BSP) includes
NUC140 interface device driver, learning board driver, and sample codes.

It is designed for educational purpose.

In order to use it, you will need to install
1) Keil MDK (v4.7 or v5.02 were tested)
2) NuLink USB driver (NuLink is built-in ICE on NUC140 learning board)
3) unzip this BSP into C:\Nuvoton
